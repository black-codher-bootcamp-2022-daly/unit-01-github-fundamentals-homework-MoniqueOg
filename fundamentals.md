During the first Empowerment evening I learnt new termonology such as 'Blue Pill' and '' this in person event was particulaly impactful on me as I was able to meet mentors, other students and people on paths different to mine. During the meeting listening to Tiwa, Author of the book "Confident and Killing it" a practical guide to overcoming fear and unlocking potential; as someone who suffers from severe anxiety hearing her story in particular helped me realise mindset changes your whole perception as she spoke about comfidence and manifestation using worded moodboards.<!-- inspiring story about another speaker who spoke about coming from low income background becoming an entrepreneur of a successful business-->

configured linux, syncing wsl visual studio 

### The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
These are 12 principles that can be summarised into 4 values these are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaberation over contracted negotiations
- Responding to change over following a plan

### How to make toast?  🍞 
During this sub-module I learned the importance of clear concise steps this helped me to understand the 5 steps of a Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC):
> 1. Planning
>> 2. Analysis
>>> 3. Design
>>>> 4. Implementation
>>>> 5. Maintenence
>>>>> 6. Testing and Intergration <!--write definitions-->
 
 #### (SDLC) Pros
- lowers costs 
- improve quality
- shortening timelines 
- help developers understand project scope

#### Types of (SDLC) Methodologies

  Agile 🔂   | Waterfall 🌊
------------- | -------------
requires change       | avoids change
team without pm       | requires pm

some examples of agile are: scrum, <!--fill this out with examples of frameworks-->

## Developer roles and their differences
 learned about different areas of software development software engineering,  web development, devops engineer, mobile application, desktop development
<!--change format and wording to look neat -->

explaining the difference between front-end(html,css,js) and back-end development (python,node.js,js)and examples
 
### planning poker
consensus based agile estimating and planning technique

### source control
tracking and making changes to source code, can be uused to make changes to original source code revert changes and resolve mistakes also referred to as version control revision control or source code managment
-->

## Command Line and Git(hub)
command line is a user interface that is navigated by typing command at prompts instead of a mouse.
 ##### git vs github
 
- so far i am aware of different command line instructions in order to carry out certian functions 
with git i am aware of the functions git command  init add merge pull help
git 

- offline and online 

- learned different types of local and global

## Challenging Topics
-git/bash commands and order -f, -v, -b, push, pull
- memorising terms and  implementing them in real world scenarios

## Steps taken to overcome challenges🧗🏾‍♀️
- [x] Review previous Notes
- [ ] Open a pull request and allow mentor to review
- [ ] Research using [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) | [Github](https://github.com) | [Stacklow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [ ] Discuss amongst learners
- [ ] Utilise slack to ask tech team
